          <h1>About C#</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>C# is an object oriented, event driven, strongly typed programming language.
          It is the language of preference for .NET developers.  In fact, C# was used
          for much of the development of the .NET framework class libraries.  The language
          is often considered similar to Java, C, and C++.  It includes GUI development
          ability akin to Visual Basic, and object-oriented class libraries, like Java.
          Visual Studio is the preferred IDE for many C# programmers.
        </p>
        <p>C# supports strongly typed variables with relatively few implicit conversions.
          Array bounds and variable initialization are checked for validity.  Memory
          de-allocation is unnecessary as C# provides for automatic garbage collection.
          Safe object references are used to ensure all references are made to live
          objects or null objects.  Random memory location access, as well as a dead
          pointer, is impossible.
        </P>

          <h1>Data Types and Variables</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>C# utilizes the common type system (CTS) of the .NET framework.  These
          types are divided into two categories: Value types and Reference types.
          The following are the primitive value types:
          <ul>
            <li>int</li>
            <li>char</li>
            <li>double</li>
            <li>char</li>
            <li>decimal</li>
            <li>bool</li>
            <li>byte</li>
          </ul>
          Multiple sizes of many of these types are also allowed e.g. float, short,
          long.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the primitive types, Classes, including user designed classes,
          structs, and enumerated types are also allowed. Type conversion must be done
          explicitly, usually through casting.
        </p>
        <p>Variables in C# must be declared with a type and identifier. The type must
          be one of the primitive types or declared types from above.  The identifier
          can be any unique string of alphabetic, numeric, and the underscore ('_')
          character.  Identifiers may not begin with a number. Variables may also be
          initialized at declaration, but are not required to.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              //integer declaration
              int num;

              //integer declaration and initialization
              int num = 22;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>C# supports implicitly typed variable declaration with the var keyword.
          The declared variable is assigned a type at compile time, and does not change
          (strongly typed).
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              //implicit variable declaration and initialization
              var expr1 = 13 + (11 % 3);
              var expr2 = 10.4 + (3 * 2);
          </code>
        </pre>
         <p>In the code above the first variable declaration results in expr1 being
           declared with type int.  In the second line of code expr2 is similarly declared
           as type double.
         </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Statements">
        <header>
          <h1>Statements</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>C# programs consist of a series of executable statements. Statements are
          often defined in terms of other embedded statements.  A block allows a series
          of statements placed inside curly braces to replace a single statement.  All
          statements must be separated by a semicolon. Spacing is not specified, but
          usually conforms to style much like that of Java.  Statements can be any
          of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Declarations</li>
            <li>Expressions</li>
            <li>Selection Statements</li>
            <li>Iteration Statements</li>
            <li>Jump Statements</li>
            <li>Exception Handling</li>
          </ul>
          Each of these categories will be discussed in detail in the following sections,
          including examples. This list is not exhaustive. Other valid statements
          include checked/unchecked, lock, and goto, but will not be discussed further
          here.
        </p>
        <h2>Declaration Statements</h2>
        <p>These statements are used to declare a local variable. Often this statement
          is used in conjunction with an immediate assignment of the declared variable.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              int number;             //variable declaration
              const int NUMBER;       //variable declared as a constant value
              int number = 16;        //variable declared and assigned value of 16</code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Expression Statements</h2>
        <p>Expression statements are used to evaluate expressions.  Expressions that
          can be evaluated include arithmetic operations, assignments using =, as
          mentioned above, method calls, increment and decrement operations, and
          object allocations.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              int number = 11;                    //assignments
              number = (14 + 4) / 2;              //arithmetic expression
              Console.WriteLine("Output");        //method invocation
              number++;                           //increment
              object name = new object();         //memory allocation for a new instance of an object</code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Selection Statements</h2>
        <p>Selection statements, often called conditional statements, select an action
          based on the value of some condition.  These statements allow programs to
          make decisions.  C# utilizes two decision making structures: if (including
          if...else, and if...else if...else) and switch.
        </p>
        <p>If statements test a condition, and only perform the following action when
          the condition is met.  These statements can also be followed by an optional
          else statement whose contents is executed only if the condition is not met.
          If...else statements can be chained in the following form to test for a series
          of conditions: if...else if...else.  Any number of 'else if' statements
          can be included.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              if (number > 5)
                Console.WriteLine("The number is larger than five");

              if (number > 5)
                Console.WriteLine("The number is larger than five");
              else
                Console.WriteLine("The number is smaller than five");

              if (number < 3)
                Console.WriteLine("The number is small.");
              else if (number < 7)
                Console.WriteLine("The number is medium.");
              else
                Console.WriteLine("The number is large.");</code>
        </pre>
        <p>Switch statements choose between a series of mutually exclusive options,
          based on the value of an evaluated expression. If the value of each case
          matches the value of the condition, statements that follow are executed.
          If nocase matches, a default reult may be provided.  Each case ends with
          a break statement, which exits the switch construct.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              int n = Result(expression);             //n has a value calculated in the Result() method
              switch (n)
              {
                case 0:
                  Console.WriteLine("Result = 0");
                  break;
                case 1:
                  Console.WriteLine("Reslut = 1");
                  break;
                default:
                  Console.WriteLine("Result non-binary");
                  break;
              }</code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Iteration Statements</h2>
        <p>Iteration statements, often called loops, are those which allow a statement,
          or a block of statements, to be repeated.  C# has a number of different
          iteration statements, each for different applications.  While, for, and
          foreach will be discussed here.
        </p>
        <p>While statements allow a block to be repeated until a condition is met.
        Each pass through the loop begins with an evaluation of a conditional expression.
        If the expression evaluates to true, the actions contained in the loop are executed,
        then the loop starts over. A do statement may be added at the beginning to
        ensure the loop executes at least once.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              int i = 64;
              while (i > 8)
              {
                i = i / 2;
              }</code>
        </pre>
        <p>For loops are constructed to iterate over a loop a specific number of
          times. A for command contains the iterator variable, often i or j, the
          condition to evaluate, and some sort of modification of the iterator, usually
          an increment or decrement.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
              {
                total += i;
              }</code>
        </pre>
        <p>The final iteration statement, foreach, iterates a block of code over
          the members of a collection. This is often used to perform a calculation
          on all members of a specified or calculated list, without the necessity of
          knowing the length ofthe collection.
        </p>
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
              foreach (string word in A)            //assume string[] A has been
              {                                     //has been previously defined
                result += string;
              }</code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Jump Statements</h2>
        <p>Jump statements transfer control to another portion of the program.  Previously,
          we have seen break used to end a switch statement.  Its counterpart, continue,
          is used when a potential outcome of a selection results in no code to execute.
          Also commonly used is return, which sends control back to where a method was called.
        </p>
        <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
        <p>These statements are used to isolate a portion of code and allow runtime exceptions
          to be handled programmatically, rather than cause termination.  In C#,
          try, catch, throw, and finally are used for exception handling.

          <h1>Object-Oriented Features</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>C# is designed to be object-oriented.  A class structure defines the language.
          All statements must be part of a class.  Classes can inherit from another
          class, but may only inherit from one class.  Abstract classes may be defined.
          Classes inheriting from these must implement all methods declared in the
          abstract class. Methods may be overridden in inherited classes and virtual
          methods requiring implementation may be declared.
        </p>
        <p>Interfaces can be used to force common functionality onto a class.  They
          contain only the signature of members that must be implemented by any class
          that implements the interface. A class can implement any number of interfaces.
          The .NET framework relies heavily on interfaces to provide common functionality
          to many of its included classes.
        </p>
        <p>Polymorphism is achieved not only through overriding inherited class members,
          but also through generics.  Generic classes or methods use one definition
          to operate on multiple types.  For example, Stack&lt;T&gt;, defines
          a stack structure that can accomodate any type, indicated by T.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Windows_Programming">
        <header>
          <h1>Windows Programming</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>C#, used in conjunction with Visual Studio allows for easy drag-and-drop
          construction of Windows programs with interactive graphical user interfaces,
          much like in Visual Basic.  The System.Windows.Forms namespace contains
          many classes for Windows Form control.  Included among these are the typical
          button, label, and textbox controls familiar to Windows users.
        </p>
        <p>Windows applications are usually event-driven.  Rather than execute code
          sequentially, these applications remain in a process loop and execute sections
          of code based on events such as mouse clicks, data entry, and clock-based
          events.  When an event is registered, a method known as an event-handler
          is executed.  These event-handlers can range from very simple, to extremely
          complex, and may update properties, data, or invoke other methods. After
          completion, control is returned to the process loop to execute the next event,
          or wait for an event to be registered.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Web_Programming">
        <header>
          <h1>Web Programming</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>Web applications are developed using Active Server Pages, or ASP.NET.
          Drag-and-drop GUI design is done similarly to Windows programs, with use
          of the many control classes familiar to web users.  Web applications are
          usually event-driven as well to allow much user interaction.
        </p>
        <p>Web programs are executed in a browser, such as Chrome or Firefox.  The
          browser interprets an HTML, <em>Hyper-Text Markup Language</em>, file, and
          renders the content to be viewed.  More precisely, ASP.NET uses XHTML,
          rather than HTML, with the X meaning <em>extensible</em>.  This platform
          allows both client-side scripting and processing done on the server.
          Client-side processing occurs with embedded scripts using a scripting language,
          most commonly JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>When a web page is desired, a request is sent to the server, where the
          files are stored, which sends a response to the client that includes the
          mark-up code for the web page. When an action like filling out a form field
          or clicking a button requires action from the application a new request is
          sent to the server to process and return to the client.  Each subsequent update
          requires a similar round-trip to the server. Server side processing uses C#
          to execute program logic at the server to be sent to the client.

      <section class="main-section" id="ADO.NET">
        <header>
          <h1>ADO.NET</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>ADO.NET stands for ActiveX Data Objects for .NET.  These classes are used
          for interaction with databases, including Microsoft Access, Oracle, and SQL Server.
          ADO.NET uses a feature called data providers to allow access to multiple
          database architecture.  Each data provider implements many classes to retrieve,
          manipulate, and update data. The following are core classes that make up
          each ADO.NET data provider:
          <ul>
            <li>Connection</li>
            <li>Command</li>
            <li>DataReader</li>
            <li>DataAdapter</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The Connection class is used to instantiate a connection object based on
          the type of database being referenced. A platform specific connection string
          is required along with a data source.  This object then represents an open
          database connection.  The Command class holds a SQL statement used for data
          retrieval.  DataReader classes retrieve rows from a database using its
          connection and command objects.  DataAdapter objects exhange data between
          data sources and the dataset, which is the in-memory representation of the
          data.
        </p>
        <p>Other classes and objects beyond the core classes are available as well.
          These, in fact, barely scratch the surface of datbase operations using C#.
          One of these, the DataGridView class, is widely used to format and display
          data in a familiar row and column structure for Windows Forms.

          <h1>LINQ</h1>
          <hr>
        </header>
        <p>LINQ, or <em>Language Integrated Query,</em> is a way to query over a collection.
          Using queries natural to relational databases in the programming language
          allows data manipulation independently of data sources.  In other words,
          the differences in database systems are smoothed out by writing queries
          in (usually) server side code.
        </p>
        <p>Queries can also be written against collections of objects. Any data type
          that implements the IEnumerable<T> interface can be queried over.  In addition
          to relational data and XML data, this also includes arrays, which extends
          the functionality as most complex data structures are implemented using arrays
          in C#.
        </p>
        <p>C# maintains a number of contextual keywords to facilitate these operations.
          In other circumstances they are not considered keywords, but in a query
          the following keywords are also recognized:
          <ul>
            <li>from</li>
            <li>select</li>
            <li>where</li>
            <li>equals</li>
            <li>in</li>
            <li>on</li>
            <li>into</li>
